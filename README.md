Claude Code… Status Line Metrics
Building a Smarter Claude Code Statusline (With Costs and Suggestions)

I Built a Real-Time Dashboard Into Claude Code's Status Line (And It Uses Data You Didn't Know Existed)
TL;DR: Claude Code sends a rich JSON payload to custom statusline scripts on every interaction - - actual cost, context usage, session duration, token counts, and more. I built a ~400 line bash script that turns this into a live dashboard showing everything you need to make smart decisions about pacing, context management, and parallel sessions.

---

The Problem: Flying Blind
My workflow with Claude Code isn't one terminal, one task. It's multiple terminals, multiple projects, all sharing the same Anthropic account. Each instance burns tokens independently, but the rate limit is shared.
I couldn't see:
How much I was spending right now (not after the fact)
How fast my context window was filling - - and when auto-compaction would wipe my conversation state
Whether my tools were failing silently in retry loops
What my actual aggregate burn rate was across all sessions

I needed a status line. Not a separate monitoring tool, not a browser tab, not a TUI - - something inside Claude Code that updates on every interaction.
The Insight: Claude Code Sends You Everything
Here's what most people don't realize: Claude Code's statusline hook doesn't just call your script - - it pipes a JSON payload via stdin containing the current session's actual metrics. Cost, context, duration, model, token breakdown - - all of it. No estimation needed.
{
  "session_id": "420c9207-5fd1-4456-abd0-e14456ee16ba",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/naveen/.claude/projects/.../420c9207.jsonl",
  "model": {"id": "claude-opus-4-6", "display_name": "Opus 4.6"},
  "version": "2.1.39",
  "cost": {
    "total_cost_usd": 3.56,
    "total_duration_ms": 1472713,
    "total_api_duration_ms": 772588,
    "total_lines_added": 306,
    "total_lines_removed": 554
  },
  "context_window": {
    "total_input_tokens": 20147,
    "total_output_tokens": 42321,
    "context_window_size": 200000,
    "current_usage": {
      "input_tokens": 3,
      "output_tokens": 9,
      "cache_creation_input_tokens": 4,
      "cache_read_input_tokens": 43791
    },
    "used_percentage": 22,
    "remaining_percentage": 78
  }
}
That cost.total_cost_usd is the real number --- not an estimate from a pricing table. The context_window.used_percentage is Claude's own calculation. No guessing.
The previous version of this script estimated cost by parsing JSONL session files and multiplying token counts by model-specific rates. It worked, but it was always approximate. Now? The source of truth comes straight from Claude Code.
JSONL files (at ~/.claude/projects/<project-dir>/<session-id>.jsonl) are still useful for one thing: tool and message stats. Claude's native JSON doesn't include tool breakdowns, so the script parses the session transcript for those.
What I Built: 9 Lines of Real-Time Intelligence
Claude Code supports a custom status line via settings.json. Point it at a shell script, and it renders the output below your prompt on every interaction. Here's what mine looks like:

At a glance, I know exactly where I stand. Let me walk through what each line does and why it matters.

Line by Line: What You're Looking At
Line 1 - - Session Context
📁 ~/my-project  🤖 Opus 4.6  📟 2.1.39  🌿 main*(+2~3?1)
The basics: where you are, which model is running (this directly affects pricing), your CLI version, and your git state. The dirty indicators are compact but information-dense:
+2 = 2 files staged
~3 = 3 files modified but unstaged
?1 = 1 untracked file
* = uncommitted changes exist

Why include git? Because I've kicked off expensive Claude operations on the wrong branch more times than I'd like to admit.
Line 2 - - Context Window & Compaction Countdown
🧠 Context: 43.8K/200.0K (22%) • Until compact: 1h 27m ▓▓░░░░░░░░
This is the line that changed how I work. Claude Code has a 200K token context window. When it fills, auto-compaction fires - - the conversation gets summarized, detail is lost, and you burn extra tokens in the process.
The "Until compact" timer calculates context velocity (tokens consumed per minute based on your session history) and projects when you'll hit the wall:
context_velocity=$(( actual_context_tokens * 60 / session_elapsed ))
tokens_remaining=$(( MAX_CONTEXT - actual_context_tokens ))
minutes_to_full=$(( tokens_remaining / context_velocity ))
When this says 12m, I know to run /compact proactively rather than letting Claude do it mid-task and lose important context.
Line 3 - - Cost & Token Breakdown
💰 $3.56 ($8.70/hr) • In:20.1K Out:42.3K Cache:43.8K
The cost is actual - - pulled directly from cost.total_cost_usd in Claude Code's native JSON. No pricing tables, no estimation. The hourly rate is calculated from the real cost and session wall time.
The token breakdown shows cumulative session totals: input tokens, output tokens, and cache read tokens. This tells you where the tokens are going. A high Cache number relative to Input means prompt caching is working well.
calc_cost=$(n cost_usd "0")  # Actual cost from Claude Code
cost_per_hour=$(echo "scale=2; $calc_cost / $session_hours" | bc)
Line 4 - - Session Timing & Cache Efficiency
⏱️  Session: 0h 24m (API: 12m 52s) • Cache: 99%
Wall clock time vs. actual API time. In this example, the session is 24 minutes old but Claude spent 12m 52s of that on API calls. The rest is you reading output, thinking, and typing.
The cache hit rate shows what percentage of your prompt tokens were served from cache vs. sent fresh. Higher = faster responses and lower cost per interaction. Both timing values come from Claude Code's native total_duration_ms and total_api_duration_ms.
Line 5 - - Token & Tool Analytics
📊 62.5K tok • 💬 18 msgs • 🔧 R:12 E:5 B:8 W:2
Total token consumption, conversation length, and a tool usage breakdown:
R = Read (file reads)
E = Edit (file modifications)
B = Bash (shell commands)
W = Write (new file creation)

This breakdown is surprisingly useful. If I see B:47 and the session is only 20 minutes old, something is probably in a retry loop. If W:12 is high, I'm generating a lot of new files and should check nothing was duplicated. These stats come from parsing the session JSONL file --- the one metric that still requires file parsing.
Line 6 - - Activity & Code Impact
📂 4 files • ⚡ 1.8K/min • ✅ 98% tools • 📝 +306/-554 lines
Files touched (unique files edited or written), context velocity (how fast tokens are being consumed - - your "speedometer"), tool success rate (calculated from tool_use_error counts in the session log), and lines of code changed (from Claude Code's native total_lines_added / total_lines_removed).
The tool success rate is an early warning. If it drops below 90%, the status message changes to flag it:
if [ "$tool_success_rate" -lt 90 ]; then
  status_msg="⚠️ ${tool_success_rate}% tool success - Errors may be causing retries, check output"
fi
Line 7 - - Peak Context & Compaction History
📈 Peak: 43.8K • 🔄 2x compact
Peak context tracks the highest context window usage during the session - - persisted across compactions in a state file. The compaction counter detects when context drops by 50%+ (the signature of auto-compaction):
if [ "$actual_context_tokens" -lt $(( LAST_CONTEXT_TOKENS / 2 )) ]; then
  COMPACTION_COUNT=$(( ${COMPACTION_COUNT:-0} + 1 ))
fi
On heavy sessions I've seen 🔄 138x compact. That number is a wake-up call about how much context you're churning through.
Line 8 - - Multi-Session Awareness (Conditional)
🌐 +2 other session(s): $8.45 (650.2K tok) • $12.30/hr
This line only appears when other Claude Code sessions are actively running (any session JSONL file modified in the last 5 minutes, excluding your current session). It sums costs and tokens across every other active instance.
Why 5 minutes instead of 60? Active sessions write to their JSONL file on every interaction, so a 5-minute window catches real concurrent sessions without false positives from old session files that happened to be touched recently. And by excluding the current session, you'll never see "1 session running" - - you already know about your own.
# Exclude current session, only count others modified in last 5 min
while IFS= read -r sf; do
  sf_base=$(basename "$sf")
  [ "$sf_base" = "$current_jsonl" ] && continue
  # ... sum costs and tokens
done < <(find "$HOME/.claude/projects" -name "*.jsonl" -type f -mmin -5)
Line 9 - - Status & Recommendations
The bottom line runs through a priority-ordered decision tree and tells you what matters right now:
MessageTriggerWhat To Do🚨 Memory almost full (92%) - Run /compact now or start a new sessionContext >90%Auto-compaction is imminent. You'll lose detail.⚠️ Memory filling up (78%) - Run /compact soon to free spaceContext 75--90%Getting tight. Proactively compact before it's forced.⚡ Using memory fast (3.2K/min) - Break task into smaller stepsVelocity >3K/minYour prompts/responses are large. Chunk the work.🔄 Compacted 5x - Session is long.

Check for retry loops.✅ 2 other session(s) also running - $12.30/hr combinedOther sessions activeFYI --- your parallel sessions are spending this much.✅ All goodNothing to worry aboutCarry on.
The design philosophy: every message explains what's happening AND what to do about it. No jargon like "cache hit rate" or unexplained numbers. If you need to act, the message tells you how.

The Architecture: Native JSON + JSONL Hybrid
The v4.0 script uses a two-source approach:
Primary source: Claude Code's native JSON (piped via stdin)
Cost (cost.total_cost_usd) --- actual, not estimated
Context usage (context_window.*) --- percentage, token counts, window size
Duration (cost.total_duration_ms, cost.total_api_duration_ms)
Code changes (cost.total_lines_added, cost.total_lines_removed)
Model, version, session ID, transcript path

Secondary source: Session JSONL (file parsing, for tool stats only)
Message count
Tool breakdown (Read, Edit, Bash, Write)
Tool success rate
Files touched

This hybrid approach gets the best of both worlds: accurate metrics from the source of truth, plus detailed tool analytics that only exist in the transcript.
# Extract everything from native JSON in one pass
native=$(echo "$input" | jq '{
  cost_usd:    (.cost.total_cost_usd // 0),
  wall_ms:     (.cost.total_duration_ms // 0),
  ctx_used_pct: (.context_window.used_percentage // 0),
  # ... 15+ more fields
}')
# JSONL only for tool stats
tool_metrics=$(jq -s '{
  tool_read: [.[] | select(.message.content[]?.name == "Read")] | length,
  # ... tool breakdowns
}' "$session_file")

---

Performance: It Has to Be Fast
A status line that lags is worse than no status line. Several optimizations keep render time negligible:
Render throttling: Skip if last render was <2 seconds ago.
if [ $(( now_ts - STATUSLINE_LAST_RENDER )) -lt 2 ]; then exit 0; fi
Native JSON first: Most metrics come from a single jq extraction of the stdin payload --- no file I/O at all. Only tool stats require reading the JSONL file.
Single-pass JSONL extraction: When we do read the session file, one jq -s call returns all tool metrics at once instead of making separate passes.
Persistent state: Peak context, compaction count, and session start time are persisted to a .usage_state file so they survive across renders without re-scanning history.
Tight aggregate window: Only scanning JSONL files modified in the last 5 minutes (not 60) means fewer files to parse for multi-session tracking.

---

Setup (2 Minutes)
1. Save the script
# Save statusline.sh to ~/.claude/statusline.sh
chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline.sh
2. Configure Claude Code
Add to ~/.claude/settings.json:
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
3. Install dependencies
# macOS
brew install jq bc
# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install jq bc
That's it. Next time Claude Code renders, you'll see the full dashboard.

---

Why This Approach Works
I tried the other approach first - - a separate monitoring utility. It meant:
Version drift between the monitor and Claude Code
Stale data from polling intervals
Cost estimates that drifted from reality
Another process to babysit

The status line script uses only what's already there:
bash - - it's your shell
Claude Code's native JSON - - piped to your script on every render
Session JSONL files - - already written by Claude Code (only for tool stats)
git - - you're already in a repo
jq/bc - - standard utilities

No daemon. No network calls. No pricing tables to keep updated. The cost is actual, not estimated. Less ceremony, more clarity.

---

From Numbers to Decisions: The Wave Strategy
The status line wasn't the end goal - - it was the input to a decision framework. The whole point is answering: "What can I safely hand off to Claude right now?"
The Delegation Decision Tree
Every time I'm about to kick off a task, I glance at the status line and make a call:
Status Line SaysWhat I DoContext <50%, ✅ All goodGo wide. Spin up parallel sessions. Run the big refactor. Let Claude loose on multi-file changes.Context 50--75%, velocity moderateStay focused. One session at a time. Targeted edits, not open-ended exploration.Context 75--90%, ⚠️ Memory filling upWrap up. Finish current tasks, don't start new ones. Run /compact proactively.Context >90%, 🚨 Memory almost fullCompact or restart. /compact now, or start a fresh session with /clear.
Wave Mode: Staged Orchestration
When I have a large task - - say, implementing a full feature across 8 files - - I don't throw it all at Claude in one shot. I run it in waves, using the status line to pace each stage:
Wave 1 (Architecture): Ask Claude to plan the approach. Low token cost, high value. Check the status line - - context should still be low.
Wave 2 (Core Implementation): Implement the main logic. This is the expensive wave. Watch ⚡ velocity/min --- if it spikes above 3K/min, you're burning context fast. Watch the Until compact timer.
Wave 3 (Integration): Wire everything together. If context is getting high from Wave 2, /compact first. The compaction counter tells you if Claude already auto-compacted (and lost detail you might need).
Wave 4 (Testing & Cleanup): Run tests, fix edge cases. By now, check the aggregate line - - if other sessions are also active, your total burn rate adds up.
The 📈 Peak: 156.2K • 🔄 2x compact line tells you how many waves you've effectively been through. Each compaction roughly marks a wave boundary where context was reset.
Pro Tips for High-Throughput Workflows
When context velocity spikes: Run /compact to reclaim context, then switch to /model sonnet for routine work. Sonnet is cheaper than Opus for output tokens.
When context is high: Add "Be concise. Code only, minimal explanation." to your CLAUDE.md --- this persistently reduces verbose output across all sessions.
Long sessions: Watch the compaction counter. If it's climbing fast (🔄 5x compact in an hour), your tasks are too broad. Break them into focused, disposable sessions.
Cost-aware model switching: The 🤖 model indicator reminds you which pricing tier you're on. Use /model sonnet mid-session for tasks that don't need Opus-level reasoning and watch the $/hr rate drop.

---

What I Learned Running This for Months
Compaction count is a better metric than token count. My .usage_state file shows COMPACTION_COUNT=138 on one project. That's 138 times the context was auto-summarized. Each compaction loses nuance. Seeing that number climb made me change how I structure tasks --- smaller, more focused sessions instead of marathon conversations.
Native JSON beats estimation. The previous version estimated cost from token counts and a pricing table. It was close but never exact, and the pricing table needed manual updates when Anthropic changed rates. Getting total_cost_usd directly eliminated an entire class of bugs.
Active session detection needs a tight window. The first version counted any JSONL file modified in the last 60 minutes as an "active session." One debugging session where I read old session files triggered false positives - - suddenly showing "12 sessions running" when only 1 was active. Tightening to 5 minutes and excluding the current session fixed this completely.
Tool breakdown catches pathological patterns. When Bash calls spike (B:40+ in a short session), something is usually in a retry loop. When Write calls are high, check for duplicated file creation. The status line turns these invisible failure modes into scannable numbers.
Status messages must be human-readable. Early versions showed things like "Cache 99% hit rate" and "Throttle: 2.1h 🟢." Users (including me) misinterpreted these constantly. The current version says exactly what's happening and what to do: "Memory filling up (78%) - - Run /compact soon to free space." If a message needs explanation, it's a bad message.

---

Customization Ideas
The script is ~400 lines of bash and every metric is modular. Some things to try:
Add per-model cost tracking: Track how much you spend on Opus vs. Sonnet per session
Burn rate smoothing: Average context velocity over the last N minutes instead of session lifetime
Auto-compact triggers: Use a Claude Code hook to automatically run /compact when context hits a threshold
Slack/webhook alerts: Send a notification when aggregate spend crosses a threshold
Session tagging: Add task labels to the status line so you know what each session is working on

---

Final Thought
Sometimes the cleanest fix isn't "one more tool" - - it's using what you already have, better. Claude Code's native statusline JSON was sitting there the whole time, containing everything I needed to make informed decisions about pacing, context, and cost.
~400 lines of bash. No daemon. No dependencies. Real-time visibility into every metric that matters.
If you adapt this for your workflow, I'd love to hear what you add.
