# Understanding Your Claude Code Intelligent Status Line

Your Claude Code status line provides real-time insights into your AI development session. Here's what each element means:

## 📁 **Project Context**
**`📁 ~/.claude  🤖 Sonnet 4  📟 v1.0.81`**

- **📁 ~/.claude**: Current working directory - you're in your Claude configuration folder
- **🤖 Sonnet 4**: AI model being used (Claude Sonnet 4, the most capable model)
- **📟 v1.0.81**: Your Claude Code CLI version

## ⌛ **API Usage Cycle**
**`⌛ 22h 12m until reset at 08:28 (7%) ----------`**

- **22h 12m**: Time remaining in your 24-hour API usage window
- **08:28**: Exact time when your usage quota resets (tomorrow at 8:28 AM)
- **7%**: You've used 7% of your daily usage window (about 1h 48m into the cycle)
- **Progress bar**: Visual indicator showing 7% usage (mostly empty bars)

*This helps you pace your AI usage and know when limits refresh.*

## 📊 **Token Analytics**
**`📊 25M tok (644559/min) • 🧠 Context: 27% MODERATE • 💰 ~$75/20h`**

### Token Usage
- **25M tok**: Total tokens consumed (25 million tokens across input, output, and cached content)
- **644559/min**: Current burn rate - you're consuming ~644K tokens per minute
- **High-speed development**: This indicates intensive AI-assisted coding

### Context Management  
- **🧠 Context: 27% MODERATE**: You're using 27% of Claude's 200K context window
- **MODERATE status**: Healthy context usage - not approaching limits
- **Auto-managed**: Claude handles context optimization automatically

### Cost Tracking
- **💰 ~$75**: Estimated cost based on token consumption
- **/20h**: This cost accumulated over 20 hours of development
- **~$3.75/hour**: Your effective hourly rate for AI assistance

## 🎯 **Resource Management**
**`🎯 🟢 GREEN • ✅ API 93% LEFT • 🌊 Wave:5 • ⚡ High burn - Consider --delegate --uc`**

### Resource Zones
- **🟢 GREEN**: Optimal operating zone - full speed development
- **✅ API 93% LEFT**: 93% of your API quota remains available
- **Healthy margins**: You're well within safe usage limits

### Advanced Features
- **🌊 Wave:5**: Multi-stage orchestration available for complex tasks
- **Wave mode**: Enables sophisticated multi-agent workflows for enterprise-level development

### Performance Optimization
- **⚡ High burn**: You're consuming tokens rapidly (644K/min)
- **--delegate**: Suggests using parallel processing for efficiency
- **--uc**: Recommends ultra-compressed mode to reduce token usage

## 💡 **What This Tells You**

**Development Intensity**: You're in an intensive coding session with high AI assistance

**Cost Efficiency**: At $75 over 20 hours, you're getting significant value for complex development

**Resource Health**: Well within limits with 93% API quota and 73% context remaining

**Optimization Opportunities**: The system suggests delegation and compression to maximize efficiency

## 🎨 **Resource Zone Colors**

| Zone | Color | Usage | Recommendation |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 0-60% | Full speed | Optimal for complex tasks |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 60-75% | Auto-optimization | Consider efficiency modes |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 75-85% | Warning alerts | Defer non-critical operations |
| 🔴 RED | 85-95% | Force efficiency | Essential operations only |
| 🚨 CRITICAL | 95%+ | Emergency protocols | Save work immediately |

## 📈 **Context Status Levels**

| Status | Usage | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **OK** | <50% | Plenty of context available |
| **MODERATE** | 50-75% | Healthy usage, no concerns |
| **LOW** | 75-90% | Approaching limits |
| **CRITICAL** | 90%+ | Auto-compacting soon |
| **Auto-managed** | N/A | Fallback when data unavailable |

## 💰 **Cost Calculation**

The cost display shows:
- **Estimated cost**: Based on ~$3 per 1M tokens (conservative Sonnet 4 pricing)
- **Timeframe**: Duration over which costs accumulated
- **Real-time**: Updates as you use Claude Code
- **Project-specific**: Different projects track separately

**Example interpretations:**
- `💰 ~$75/20h` = $75 over 20 hours (~$3.75/hour)
- `💰 ~$12/2d` = $12 over 2 days (~$6/day)
- `💰 ~$5/today` = $5 accumulated today

## 🚀 **Advanced Recommendations**

When you see optimization suggestions:

### **--delegate**
Use parallel processing for large operations:
```bash
/analyze --delegate auto
/improve --delegate files
```

### **--uc (Ultra Compressed)**
Reduce token usage by 30-50%:
```bash
/build --uc
/implement --uc --validate
```

### **--wave-mode**
Enable multi-stage orchestration:
```bash
/improve --wave-mode progressive
/analyze --wave-mode systematic
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Token Calculation
- **Input tokens**: Your prompts and context
- **Output tokens**: Claude's responses
- **Cache tokens**: Reused context (cheaper)
- **Real-time**: Calculated from live session files

### Session Tracking
- **Project-specific**: Each directory tracks separately
- **Persistent**: Survives Claude Code restarts
- **Accurate**: Based on actual Claude API usage

### Time Tracking
- **File-based**: Uses session file timestamps
- **Automatic**: No manual tracking required
- **Precise**: Down to the minute accuracy
